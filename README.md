### Day 1 of 300DaysOfGenerativeAI
- In today's session on mastering PyTorch, I focused on the foundational aspects of deep learning, particularly through the "Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz" tutorial. I learned about neural network architectures, including fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent layers, and explored PyTorch's key modules such as torch.autograd for automatic differentiation and torch.nn for building networks. I practiced forward and backward propagation, loss calculation, and gradient descent, culminating in the construction of a simple feed-forward neural network. On upcoming sessions, my agenda includes a deep dive into the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), their architectural evolution, and hands-on development of models like LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, Inception v3, ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNets, discussing their significance and future in deep learning.

### Day 2 of 300DaysOfGenerativeAI
- In today's session on Mastering PyTorch, I had a brief but productive session diving into deep CNN architectures. I explored why CNNs are so effective for tasks like image classification and object detection, highlighting their parameter efficiency, automatic feature extraction, and hierarchical learning. I reviewed various architectural innovations such as spatial, depth, width, and multi-path-based CNNs. I also examined an implementation of AlexNet in PyTorch, focusing on its layer structure and how it leverages dropout and activation functions. Additionally, I noted the availability of various pre-defined CNN models in PyTorchâ€™s torchvision package, including AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and others.

### Day 3 of 300DaysOfGenerativeAI
- In today's session on Mastering PyTorch, I have prepared a dataset for an image classification task, implemented a fine-tuning process for a pre-trained AlexNet model, and addressed a deterministic behavior issue that arose during training. I created data loaders, defined helper functions for visualization and model fine-tuning, and modified the final layer of the pre-trained model to match the number of classes in my dataset. During the fine-tuning process, I encountered a warning related to the use of the` adaptive_avg_pool2d_backward_cuda` operation, which does not have a deterministic implementation. To address this, I learned about different approaches to enable deterministic behavior in PyTorch, such as selectively disabling determinism for the problematic operation or using the `warn_only=True` option when enabling deterministic algorithms.This hands-on experience has provided me with a deeper understanding of practical considerations when applying deep learning techniques to image classification problems.
