### Day 1 of 300DaysOfGenerativeAI
- In today's session on mastering PyTorch, you focused on the foundational aspects of deep learning, particularly through the "Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz" tutorial. You learned about neural network architectures, including fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent layers, and explored PyTorch's key modules such as torch.autograd for automatic differentiation and torch.nn for building networks. You practiced forward and backward propagation, loss calculation, and gradient descent, culminating in the construction of a simple feed-forward neural network. Tomorrow, your agenda includes a deep dive into the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), their architectural evolution, and hands-on development of models like LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, Inception v3, ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNets, discussing their significance and future in deep learning.
