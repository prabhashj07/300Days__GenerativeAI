# Note-Taking Guide Using the Cornell Method

## Introduction

The Cornell Method is an effective way to take notes for research papers, especially in complex fields like AI, ML, and medical imaging. This method helps organize notes systematically, making them easier to review and study later.

## How to Use the Cornell Method

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Divide Your Page into Three Sections**:
   - **Notes Section**: Use the right-hand side of your page (about 2/3 of the width) to write down detailed notes during your reading.
   - **Cues Section**: On the left-hand side (about 1/3 of the width), write keywords, questions, or main points related to your notes.
   - **Summary Section**: At the bottom, summarize the key points of the page or the entire paper.

2. **Read the Paper Actively**:
   - As you read, jot down main ideas, important concepts, and critical data in the **Notes Section**.
   - Write keywords, concepts, or questions in the **Cues Section** that will help you recall the information.

3. **After Reading, Summarize**:
   - At the end of each page or section, write a brief summary of the key points in the **Summary Section**. This helps reinforce what you've learned and makes review easier.

4. **Review Regularly**:
   - Use the **Cues Section** to test yourself or to prompt further research.
   - Regularly review your notes and summaries to retain the information effectively.
